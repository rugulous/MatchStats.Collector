# MatchStats.Collector
This is a *very rough* Android app to streamline the collection of football stats during a match. These stats are recorded manually and **not** through the use of smart gadgets.

## Why?
The grassroots football team I'm involved with collect certain statistics throughout their matches in order to evaluate how they are doing, and areas they can improve on. This was collected on a printed sheet with a handful of tables - 1st half/2nd half, home/away - and a handful of stats - Crosses, Shots, Shots on Target, Goals, and Crosses. However, we came to realise that this information is not massively useful without **context**. Did we have 20 shots in the space of 10 minutes, or were they evenly spaced throughout the half? Did we go 2-0 up and then come under an extreme amount of pressure? 

The current tally system does not support extrapolating such data - we simply end up with a total count at the end of the match. To get the context we needed, we would also need to record the time that the events happened. This would be a large undertaking with the current paper system - or, we could record them digitally and have the system auto-store a timestamp against them!
